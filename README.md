# Criminal Intent

Criminal intent is an Android app for noting the little misdemeanors happening around the office.  

## Overview

CriminalIntent records the details of “office crimes” – things like leaving dirty dishes in the breakroom sink or walking away from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.
With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook, or another app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.

## Development 

I wrote the app as a practice project for android development.  The app uses Fragments and displays different UI's depending on the size of the device (phones vs tablets).  I took advantage of Android's sqlite and ShareCompat to develop the app. 

## Future enhancements

It is easy to imagine this app as an internet connected app.  Maybe it can be connected to slack. There are lots of possibilities!
